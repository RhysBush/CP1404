# Clean code practices - Programming II.

## About this repository:

- This is my repository for all practicals for the Computer Programming subject CP1404.
- While I may not be perfect - I try as hard as I can to keep my code maintained and up-to-date.

## About me:

- I am a year 1, trimester 3 student attending internally at James Cook University, Townsville.

- I am a technical officer for a state school.

- I finished at the top of my class in year 12 in Digital Solutions.

## Clean code guidelines:

- Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY). Seriously, Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY). Repeating code can be reformatted to reduce
  maintenance burdens.

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Functions must serve one function and (ideally) should be reusable in multiple
  situations.

- Use docstrings. This helps any reviewer of your code understand what a particular file or function performs.

- Use comments properly. Do not use comments to explain things that are 'self-explanatory' or hard to read due to bad
  naming. Commenting does not excuse bade code.
